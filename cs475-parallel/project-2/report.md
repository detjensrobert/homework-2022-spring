## Graphs

- Tell what machine you ran this on

- What do you think the actual volume is?

- Show the performances you achieved in tables and two graphs showing:
  - Performance as a function of NUMNODES with colored lines showing different NUMT values
  - Performance as a function of NUMT with colored lines showing different NUMNODES values

- What patterns are you seeing in the speeds?

- Why do you think it is behaving this way?

- What is the Parallel Fraction for this application, using the Inverse Amdahl equation?

- Given that Parallel Fraction, what is the maximum speed-up you could ever get?
