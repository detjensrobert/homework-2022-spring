What machine you ran this on
Show the table of performances for each array size and the corresponding speedups
Show the graph of SIMD/non-SIMD speedup versus array size (one curve only)
What patterns are you seeing in the speedups?
Are they consistent across a variety of array sizes?
Why or why not, do you think?
