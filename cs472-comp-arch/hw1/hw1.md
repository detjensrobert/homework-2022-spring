## Problem 1

Please identify which of the below options represent the definitions for Moore's
Law, Dennard Scaling, and Amdahl's Law. You do not need to identify which
definition applies to each of the aforementioned concepts.

- [x] The prediction that the number of transistors on a dense IC will double
  approximately every two years.
- [x] A formula which details the theoretical speedup of a parallelized portion
  of a given system based on its reach within that system.
- [ ] An observation that as energy demands in computational systems increase
  there is a direct relationship to the performance of those systems.
- [ ] The prediction that vastly improved architecture is required to see
  continued improvements in computational power in the 21st century.
- [x] An observation that as transistors shrink their power density remains
  roughly the same.


## Problem 2

### Part A

Assume a new execution mode called "enhanced mode" provides a 2.7x speedup to
the sections of programs where it applies. What percentage of a program
(measured by original execution time) must run in enhanced mode for an overall
speedup of 8%?

### Part B

For the program identified in Part (A), what is the maximum possible speedup
with an ideal enhanced mode (i.e. the identified percentage of the program is
sped up infinitely)?
